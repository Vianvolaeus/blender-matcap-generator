# blender-matcap generator
 Blender generator for MatCaps / "Sphere Textures".

 This is a generator for Matcap textures using a combination of various lighting setups, including 'shadow lights' which remove light, and Blender's material node setup.
 
 Basic materials have been added, but it is compatible with any node groups that can be applied to a basic UV Sphere.
